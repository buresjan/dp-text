\section{Problem with one optimization parameter}
In this section, we focus on a simplified model of the TCPC in a form of a basic cylindrical junction to investigate the behavior of key hemodynamic quantities under varying caval offset. The problem setup is defined in Problem Setup \hyperlink{page.48}{1}. The dimensions of the domain, the value of the kinematic viscosity, and the value of the inflows are chosen to mimic real values occurring in physiological conditions \cite{Rijnberg2018}.

\subsection{Results and discussion}
The main objective of this study is to minimize two studied quantities, $\dot{\gamma}^{A}_{\mathrm{nw}}$ and $T^{A}_{\mathrm{turb}}$. To study the system's behavior and to validate the result generated by the optimization framework, we systematically sample the optimization space prior to running the optimization algorithm.

Specifically, we discretize the $o_1$-parameter space with regular intervals of $0{,}1$ cm over the range $[0{,}1 \, \mathrm{cm}; 2{,}4 \, \mathrm{cm}]$, creating a set of sampling points
\begin{equation}
	P = \Big\{ \, \text{P}_i \, \big| \, i=0,1,2, \dots, 24 \, \Big\} = \Big\{ \, 0{,}1 \cdot i \: \big| \, i=0,1,2, \dots, 24 \, \Big\} \, .
\end{equation}
At each point of $P$, the system's response is evaluated by computing different flow characteristics. This study serves two purposes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It provides insight into the system's behavior. Studying different geometrical setups helps with understanding of how flow characteristics vary with the changing value of parameter~$o_1$.
	\item By analyzing the sampled data, we can validate the performance of the optimization framework.
\end{itemize}
The results of the functions evaluations in the points of sampling are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:summary_metrics}

\newpage

Figure~\ref{fig:shear_rate} shows the near-wall shear rate $\dot{\gamma}^{A}_{\mathrm{nw}}$ as a function of $o_1$. At~$o_1 = 0{,}0 \, \mathrm{cm}$, where the geometry is perfectly symmetric, the shear rate is comparatively lower than it is for slightly larger offsets. Notably, we can observe sharp decrease to a local minimum at~$o_1 = 0{,}7 \, \mathrm{cm}$, i.e., an offset almost equal to 0{,}5-diameter of the IVC.  Subsequently, the shear rate exhibits a slight increase and then steadily declines to minimal values at higher offsets--around 1{,}5-diameter of the IVC.

The turbulent kinetic energy $T^{A}_{\mathrm{turb}}$ is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tke}. At $o_1 = 0{,}0 \, \mathrm{cm}$, the value is again lower compared to slightly larger offsets. The peak of the TKE occurs at $o_1 = 0{,}7 \, \mathrm{cm}$, i.e., at the offset equal to 0{,}5-diameter of the IVC. The values then steadily decrease with increasing offset.

Figure~\ref{fig:svc_flow_split} illustrates the percentage of flow from the SVC directed into the LPA and the RPA. At~$o_1 = 0{,}0 \, \mathrm{cm}$, the flow splits evenly between the LPA and RPA, reflecting the symmetry of the geometry. As the offset increases, the flow to the LPA steadily rises up to 100 \%, meaning the SVC blood flows exclusively toward the LPA. Conversely, the flow to the RPA steadily falls to 0 \%. 

The flow split from the IVC is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:ivc_flow_split}. At $o_1 = 0{,}0 \, \mathrm{cm}$, the flow splits evenly between the LPA and RPA. As the offset increases, the flow to the RPA steadily increases up to around 85 \%, where it eventually levels. As it was already described in Section \ref{objective funcs meaning}, a balanced or at least minimally maintained split of IVC blood to each pulmonary artery branch is desirable. A threshold of minimal acceptable percentage directed to either one of the parts of the pulmonary artery was set at 25 \%. The red shaded region in Figure~\ref{fig:ivc_flow_split} highlights offsets where the IVC flow fraction falls below 25 \%. This also determines a offsets considered as acceptable, i.e., those satisfying the aforementioned minimal IVC flow split. Such offsets are highlighted by the green shaded regions in Figure~\ref{fig:shear_rate} and Figure~\ref{fig:tke}.

To deepen our understanding of the systemâ€™s behavior, Table~\ref{tab:studied points} details four specific points of interest for which additional metrics and flow characteristics were examined. These points--P$_0$, P$_7$, P$_8$, P$_24$--represent notable points at the functions' behavior. The reason for why each one of the points were chosen for further examination are also detailed in Table~\ref{tab:studied points}.
