In this chapter, we analyze two proposed idealized models of the TCPC. These models are designed to incorporate key geometric modifications identified as beneficial in reducing energy dissipation, as described in \cite{Rijnberg2018}. These modifications, summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:positive_modifications}, serve as a foundation for investigating the effects of caval offsetting, curving, flaring, and other geometric factors on flow dynamics.

\section{The models}

To systematically evaluate the effects of geometric changes, the models were developed with varying levels of complexity, incorporating different numbers of degrees of freedom. Both models represent idealized TCPC geometries and share the same labeling convention for inlets and outlets. 

The inlets are denoted as $\Gamma^{\text{N}}_{\text{in}}$ (representing the superior vena cava at the top) and $\Gamma^{\text{S}}_{\text{in}}$ (representing the inferior vena cava with the conduit at the bottom). Similarly, the outlets are labeled as $\Gamma^{\text{W}}_{\text{out}}$ (representing the left part of the pulmonary artery) and $\Gamma^{\text{E}}_{\text{out}}$ (representing the right part of the pulmonary artery).
The shared geometric framework and boundary labels, is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:junction schema}. The dimensions of cylindrical segments forming the simplified junction are presented in Table~\ref{tab:tcpc dims}.

\subsection*{Model 1: Simplified cylindrical junction}
The first model represents a basic cylindrical junction with the IVC and SVC connected perpendicularly to the PA, creating a cross-like structure as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:model1_schematic}. Model 1 was chosen because it introduces only one degree of freedom, the horizontal offset of the IVC axis relative to the SVC denoted by $o_1$. This simplicity makes it possible to sample the optimization space, evaluate the studied optimization functions at the points of the sampling, providing an opportunity to study their behavior and also to verify the result arising from the optimization framework.

\subsection*{Model 2: More complex geometric model}
Illustration of Model 2 is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:model1_schematic}. The second model introduces additional complexity by incorporating six degrees of freedom:
\begin{itemize}
	\item horizontal offset of the IVC axis denoted by $o_1$,
	\item angle of connection of the IVC denoted by $\alpha_1$,
	\item angle of connection of the  SVC denoted by $\alpha_2$,
	\item width and curvature of the connection of the IVC to the PA denoted by $f_1$,
	\item width and curvature of the connection of the SVC to the PA denoted by $f_2$,
	\item width of the of the IVC denoted by $l_1$.
\end{itemize}
Model 2 was selected because its higher complexity allows for greater variations in geometry.
