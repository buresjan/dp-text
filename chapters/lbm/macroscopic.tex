\subsection{Macroscopic quantities}\label{macro}
This section presents the relations for calculating key macroscopic quantities, including density, momentum, and pressure. These relations can be derived from the general expression \eqref{eq:macroscopic basic} through discretization \cite{Kruger}. The formulas are as follows:

\begin{subequations}\label{macroeq}
	\begin{eqnarray}
		\label{rho}
		\rho &=& \sum_{k=1}^{27} f_{k},\\[3pt]
		\rho \vec{u} &=& \sum_{k=1}^{27} f_{k} \vec{\xi_{k}} + \rho \dfrac{\Delta t}{2} \vec{g},\\[3pt]
		p &=& p_0 + c_{s}^{2} (\rho - \rho_0),
	\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where $ p_0 $ \si{[-]} is the non-dimensional reference pressure, $ c_s $ \si{[-]} is the non-dimensional (lattice) speed of sound, and $ \rho_0 $ is the non-dimensional reference density. For the D3Q27 model, the lattice speed of sound is given by $ c_s = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} $. Furthermore, we consider $ \rho_0 = 1 $. A detailed description of the calculation of macroscopic quantities is provided in \cite{Kruger}.
