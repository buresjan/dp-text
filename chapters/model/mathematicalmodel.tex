\chapter{Mathematical Model}
In this chapter, we introduce the governing equations for fluid  dynamics in unbounded domains, along with an overview of turbulence modeling and Reynolds decomposition. Furthermore, the chapter addresses specific considerations relevant to blood flow in vessels and summarizes the assumptions made in the mathematical model adopted in this work.
