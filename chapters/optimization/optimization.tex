\chapter{Mathematical optimization}\label{optimization}

Mathematical optimization, also known as mathematical programming, is a broad field that covers various disciplines, including linear and nonlinear optimization, convex programming, integer programming, and more. The goal of this chapter is to summarize the key concepts and techniques relevant to the scope of this work. Specifically, we will focus on methods for solving optimization problems with constraints and those where the objective function is generally unknown and its evaluation is computationally expensive. Classic methods applicable to unconstrained optimization, such as the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell \cite{Fletcher1963} and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno \cite{broyden1970} algorithms, while fundamental, fall outside the scope of this work and details on these methods can be found for instance in \cite{Bert}.

%This chapter focuses on methods that address the specific challenges posed by constrained and generally unknown objective functions. First, a general optimization problem is defined, followed by an introduction to basic techniques for solving constrained problems. Next, black-box optimization methods are discussed. Finally, the proposed optimization framework, including its components and their interconnections, is presented in detail.
