\chapter{Mathematical optimization}\label{optimization}

%Mathematical optimization, also known as mathematical programming, is a broad field that covers various disciplines, including linear and nonlinear optimization, convex programming, integer programming, and more. The goal of this chapter is to summarize the key concepts and techniques relevant to the scope of this work. Specifically, we will focus on methods for solving optimization problems with constraints and those where the objective function is generally unknown and its evaluation is computationally expensive. Classic methods applicable to unconstrained optimization, such as the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell \cite{Fletcher1963} and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno \cite{broyden1970} algorithms, while fundamental, fall outside the scope of this work and details on these methods can be found for instance in \cite{Bert}.

Mathematical optimization, also known as mathematical programming,  is a broad field that covers wide range of methods and problem types, including linear and nonlinear optimization, convex programming, and integer programming \cite{Kochenderfer2019}. Selecting an appropriate optimization method for a given problem is a crucial step, as factors such as nonlinearity, the presence of constraints, and the computational cost of evaluating the objective function can significantly influence performance. In many cases, classic gradient-based algorithms—such as the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell \cite{Fletcher1963} or Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno \cite{broyden1970} methods—can be applied efficiently. However, these methods become less practical when gradients are difficult to obtain analytically and must instead be computed numerically. Numerical gradient estimation can be slow, computationally expensive, and prone to inaccuracies.

In this work, we solve a constrained, nonlinear optimization problem in which the objective function is computed numerically and may take several hours per evaluation. Previous studies \cite{buresBP, buresVU} examined the coupling of various optimization algorithms, including gradient-based methods, with the numerical simulations underlying our objective function. Those studies showed that gradient-based approaches are not well-suited to our current black-box setting. In contrast, gradient-free methods avoid the costs and complexities of gradient approximation, providing a more suitable option in such settings. This naturally guides us toward employing gradient-free optimization methods in this work.

When dealing with constraints, standard approaches such as penalty and barrier methods offer systematic ways to ensure feasibility \cite{Bert}. However, they often require multiple runs of a modified, unconstrained subproblem \cite{Bert}, which can become prohibitively time-consuming in our context. That is why we adopt a simplified approach to constraint handling known as the extreme barrier function \cite{BBO-textbook}, which allows us to incorporate constraints directly without extensive computational costs.

This chapter is structured as follows: First, we formally define the general optimization problem under consideration. Next, we discuss black-box optimization methods and their relevance to our scenario. Finally, we present the proposed optimization framework in detail, highlighting its components and illustrating how they are interconnected.
